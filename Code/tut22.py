# Arithmetic Operator
# print("5 + 6 is", 5 + 6)
# print("5 - 6 is", 5 - 6)
# print("5 * 6 is", 5 * 6)
# print("5 / 6 is", 5 / 6)
# print("5 ^ 6 is", 5 ** 6)  # It is exponent
# print("5 % 3 is", 5 % 3)  # It will provide the remainder
# print("5 // 6 is", 5 // 6)  # It will provide the quotient

# Assignment Operator
# x = 5
# print(x)
# # x += 7  # It will add 7 to x
# # x *= 7  # It will multiply 7 to x
# # x /= 7  # It will divide x by 7
# # x %= 7  # It will show the remainder of x/7 as x
# print(x)

# Comparison Operator
# i = 5
# print(i == 8)
# print(i != 17)
# print(i >= 45)
# print(i <= 71)

# Logical Operator
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a and a)
# print(a and b)
# print(b and b)
# print(a or b)

# Identity Operator
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a is b)
# print(a is not b)

# Membership Operator
# list1 = [3, 4, 78, 1, 4, 96]
# print(32 in list1)
# print(45 not in list1)

# Bitwise Operator (it works only as binaries)
print(0 & 1)
print(0 | 3)
